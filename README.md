# Android Netrunner arena

## Why
[Android: Netrunner](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/) doesn't have an official 'limited'
format yet, so I thought it would be fun and interesting to create my own online, by basically taking Hearthstone's 'Arena' 
format and applying it to ANR.
